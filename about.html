        <p>I'm an enthusiastic developer interested in machine learning and web technologies. Currently, I work on spam
            and phishing detection in Email team at <a href="https://seznam.cz" target="_blank">Seznam.cz</a>. Phishing
            detection was also the topic of my master thesis, which was awarded by Cisco outstanding thesis award 2015.
        </p>

        <p>Nowadays I'm using image recognition methods for spam detection as part of my Ph.D. studies. In spare time I
            play with other machine learning tasks and interesting technologies.
        </p>

        <p>I love Google technologies, that is why I joined <a href="http://gug.cz/" target="_blank">GUG.cz</a> which is
            group of people who organize events not only for developers.</p>
